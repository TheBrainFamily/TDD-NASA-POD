Starter to TheBrain Software House / Codecamps training: "Gentle introduction to realistic Test Driven Development"

Please clone this repo and run npm install.

For a reference - this is create-react-app with a few changes:
 1) updated to react-scripts@next (2.0.0) so we can use current jest, instead of a version that's over a year ago (which in jest land is ages)
 2) added .eslintrc with custom rules including prettier
 3) removed service workers (not used for demonstration purposes)
 4) linted the remaining of the code
 5) added CircleCi configuration
